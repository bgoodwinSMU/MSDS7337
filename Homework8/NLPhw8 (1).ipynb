    "Both IMDB and this analysis certainly confirm the same thing.  We can see that the review sentiment for these movies tend toward generally good reviews, each of the clusters have a mean of around 7.2, and according to IMDB these movies are certianly in a class of their own. However, since I gathered a range of review sentiments, we can see that at least one reviewer has decided that these movies are not any good and scored a value of 1 for the review.  Based on the sentiment analysis, however, it seems like most of the reviews actually express negative sentiment.  I have a few thoughts behind this, Dr.Srangelove is a \"dark\" comedy, and one of the main characters in Austin Powers is \"Dr.Evil\" and each of these words occur super frequently in each of these reviews and could accidentally skew the review information. \n",
