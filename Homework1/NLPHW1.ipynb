    "The primary takeaway from the prior to activities was to prove just this point.  After determining that a higher lexical diversity indicates a larger ratio of unique words in the context of all words, one can use this in tandem with the vocabulary count.  These two must be used together because we could have a decently high lexical diversity, but also a large vocabulary because the text is quite long and the text could be quite challenging.  Whereas with vocabulary alone we could have a low count but a very focused topic such as an academic journal.  This debate could be just like metrics for machine learning, accuracy vs recall, each can tell its own story, but once the two are combined you can see a borader perspective on what exactly is really happening.  Each on its own may not be useful, but when combined you realize the true story.  "
